# Assignment-2 Working Folders

Okay we've got this repository so we all get comfortable using GitHub by using it and there are a few other benefits to switching to this method of file sharing:

Every time you edit a file whether it's a word doc, excel sheet or audio file, you can commit and upload your changes with two button-clicks, so each of us will have access to the latest versions of everyone's work at all times instead of always needing to manually upload more files to the Microsoft Teams files tab - which doesn't keep track of changes anyway, but also:

  - The tutors will see from the activity log that we're all doing something.
  - The latest version of every working file will be available to all of us.
  - We will quickly grow comfortable with GitHub by using it.
  - All our files will be in one place

I'm sure I could think-up other benefits but they're the main ones, so if you haven't already:

<h3>Check your student email account for the invite I sent to all of you Shame and Annisa, and click whatever link is there to join the github group/organisation with the rest of us, then:<h3>

<b>1</b> Download GitHub Desktop here: https://desktop.github.com/<br>
<b>2</b> Clone this repository to your local machine.<br>
<b>3</b> Copy any/all files you've created so far to the repository's directory on your local machine.<br>
<b>4</b> Start saving new files to this directory so they're automatically included when you push your changes.<br>
<b>5</b> Push your changes in GitHub desktop anytime you've adding significant enough changes to warrant it, or every time you edit anything if you like.<br>

I've got a reasonable grasp of how it works, but I've only been using git a few weeks too and we'll figure out the weirdness together fast enough.
